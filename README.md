IWD2C-et is an exploratory experiment to achieve total translation of the game to Estonain, using the help of AI and tooling from [IWD2EE-tra](https://github.com/exsilium/IWD2EE-tra) project.

The base translation is based on Icewind Dale 2 Complete edition version available for purchase from [GoG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/icewind_dale_2).
